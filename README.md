### Date : Jan 20, 2022


### By: Tyler Coats

## Objectives
  - Create a html, css, javascript website application that runs blackjack 

## Instructions
Press "Play to begin" 
<br>Try to get to 21 without going over.


### Text Sizes

In that file, let's start by adding a title at the top of the page. The ` # ` character can be used to denote the size of the text on our current line. So let's start by typing ` # Project Title ` on the top line.

Using the Preview feature in VS Code, we can see what our markdown will look like! Open by clicking the icon, or by hitting <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>v</kbd>. You can add more ` # ` to decrease the size of the text. Try it out!  

### You Do (2 mins)
Below the title, create *date* and *author* sections using different size text. Should look like this:

### Links
You can also use markdown to add links.  Here's what that syntax looks like...

```markdown
[Link](http://www.duckduckgo.com)
```
The text of the link goes in brackets followed by the URL in parentheses.  Let's use what we learned to link to our social sites on our Project ReadMe!
### You Do (5 mins)
Create 2-3 links to your social sites right below your name. Should be any social sites you want to link.

Hint: You can combine text sizing using ` # ` with the line your links are on!

Add a "Horizontal Rule" right below your links with ` *** ` (3 asterisks).  Now create a quick "Description" section right below using one text size smaller than your "Date" above. After all is said and done, should look like this (give or take):

### Text Emphasis
You can also **bold** or *italicize* items by adding 1, 2, or 3 asterisks to each side of the item, like this:
```markdown
*italics*
**bold**
***both***
```

Let's make our section headings both **bold** and *italics*.
### Lists
Markdown can also be used to create ordered and unordered lists.  Let's create a "Technologies" section to list all of the tech we use in our project. Throw in another ` *** ` right after our Description section and let's get to it.  Lists can be done like this:
```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Sub-item

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  * Sub-item
```
We'll do our "Technologies Used" section together as well as a quick "Getting Started" section right below...

### Images
If you haven't guessed yet, you can also link images in markdown. It's very similar to a link, just add a ` ! ` right before the brackets, like this:
```markdown
![Image](http://www.imageURL.com)
```

Let's add a "Screenshots" section where we can link a few important images.

### You Do (5 mins)
Find any image on a quick DuckDuckGo search, right click it, and select "Copy Image Address". This will copy the direct link to the image so you can link it in markdown.

Practice linking a few images in your newly created "Screenshots" section. Should look like this:

### Task Lists
You can also create task lists in markdown with checked and unchecked items. We'll use this to create a "Future Updates" section on our Project ReadMe, like this:
```markdown
- [ ] Future Update 1
- [ ] Future Update 2
- [x] Completed Update
- [x] ~~Strikethrough~~ Items Also
```
Look how cool that looks! Use this section to mark items you want to come back and add to your projects in the future.

### You Do (5 mins)
Take what you've learned, and create a final section called "Credits".  It is ***critical*** that you always credit any external site or source that aided you in your project. Whether that is an image background, or a tutorial on a technology, or inspiration.  The internet is an open space (for now), but it stays that way if we act civilized and give credit where credit is due.  Set up some credits that *link* to the sources, like this:

![Credits]
